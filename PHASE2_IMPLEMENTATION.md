# Phase 2 Implementation - System Core

## ✅ Implementation Summary

Phase 2 of the vinea Core ERP system has been successfully implemented. This phase focused on building the core system components required for user management, role-based access control, company setup, and accounting period management.

## 📋 Completed Requirements

### 1. User Management (REQ-SYS-UM-*)
- ✅ User CRUD operations with secure password hashing
- ✅ User listing with pagination and search
- ✅ User activation/deactivation
- ✅ User role assignment
- ✅ Superuser support for system administration

### 2. RBAC System (REQ-SYS-RBAC-*)
- ✅ Role creation and management with granular permissions
- ✅ Permission system supporting multiple modules and actions
- ✅ API endpoint protection with permission checking
- ✅ Frontend component-level access control
- ✅ Role assignment to users with many-to-many relationship

### 3. Company Setup (REQ-SYS-COMP-*)
- ✅ Company CRUD operations
- ✅ Company details management (name, address, contact info)
- ✅ Multi-company support with data isolation
- ✅ Company-specific roles and settings

### 4. Accounting Periods (REQ-SYS-PERIOD-*)
- ✅ Financial year and period definition
- ✅ Period management with open/close functionality
- ✅ Period validation to prevent overlaps
- ✅ Transaction date validation against periods
- ✅ Current period detection

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### Models Created:
- `User` - Extended with is_superuser field
- `Role` - With JSON permissions field
- `Company` - With settings and contact info
- `AccountingPeriod` - With validation constraints
- `user_roles` - Association table for many-to-many

#### API Endpoints:
```
# Users
GET    /api/users
POST   /api/users
GET    /api/users/{id}
PUT    /api/users/{id}
DELETE /api/users/{id}

# Roles
GET    /api/roles
POST   /api/roles
GET    /api/roles/{id}
PUT    /api/roles/{id}
DELETE /api/roles/{id}
POST   /api/roles/{role_id}/assign-to-user/{user_id}
DELETE /api/roles/{role_id}/remove-from-user/{user_id}

# Companies
GET    /api/companies
POST   /api/companies
GET    /api/companies/{id}
PUT    /api/companies/{id}
DELETE /api/companies/{id}

# Accounting Periods
GET    /api/accounting-periods
POST   /api/accounting-periods
GET    /api/accounting-periods/{id}
PUT    /api/accounting-periods/{id}
DELETE /api/accounting-periods/{id}
POST   /api/accounting-periods/{id}/close
POST   /api/accounting-periods/{id}/reopen
POST   /api/accounting-periods/validate
GET    /api/accounting-periods/current
```

#### Security Features:
- JWT authentication with Bearer token
- Permission-based access control
- Password complexity validation
- Company-based data isolation
- Eager loading of roles for performance

### Frontend Components

#### Pages Created:
- `/users` - User management with search and CRUD
- `/roles` - Role management with permission matrix
- `/companies` - Company management
- `/accounting-periods` - Period management with status tracking

#### Form Components:
- `UserForm` - User creation/editing with validation
- `RoleForm` - Role management with permission selection
- `CompanyForm` - Company details management
- `AccountingPeriodForm` - Period creation with overlap validation
- `RoleAssignmentModal` - User role assignment interface

#### Features Implemented:
- Real-time search and filtering
- Pagination for large datasets
- Modal forms for CRUD operations
- Permission-based UI element hiding
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Form validation with React Hook Form + Zod

## 🔒 Permission System

The implemented permission system follows a module.action pattern:

```javascript
Available Permissions:
- gl: view, create, edit, delete, post
- ar: view, create, edit, delete, post, allocate
- ap: view, create, edit, delete, post, allocate
- inventory: view, create, edit, delete, adjust
- oe: view, create, edit, delete, approve
- users: view, create, edit, delete, assign_roles
- companies: view, create, edit, delete
- reports: view, export
- system: configure, backup, restore
```

## 🧪 Testing

A test script has been created at `backend/test_phase2.py` to verify the implementation:

```bash
cd backend
python test_phase2.py
```

This script will:
1. Create an admin user
2. Login and obtain JWT token
3. Create a test company
4. Create a test role with permissions
5. Create an accounting period
6. Verify all CRUD operations

## 🚀 Running the System

### Backend:
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Default Credentials:
- Username: admin
- Password: AdminPass123!

## 📝 Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, the system now has:
- ✅ Complete user and role management
- ✅ Multi-company support
- ✅ Accounting period control
- ✅ Permission-based access control

The foundation is ready for Phase 3: General Ledger Module implementation.

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. Frontend permission checking could be enhanced with a permission context
2. Batch operations for users/roles could improve efficiency
3. Audit logging for all operations should be implemented

## 📚 Additional Notes

- All models include created_at and updated_at timestamps
- Soft delete could be implemented for audit trail
- Password reset functionality should be added
- Email notifications for user creation could be beneficial
