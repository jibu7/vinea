# Phase 7: Order Entry Module Implementation

## Overview
The Order Entry module has been successfully implemented, providing comprehensive functionality for managing sales orders, purchase orders, and goods received vouchers (GRVs). This module integrates seamlessly with the existing AR, AP, and Inventory modules.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Database Models

#### OE Document Types (`oe_document_types`)
- Defines document types for sales and purchase transactions
- Links to AR/AP transaction types for automatic posting
- Supports: Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, GRVs, Invoices, Credit Notes

#### Sales Orders (`sales_orders` and `sales_order_lines`)
- Complete sales order management with header and line items
- Automatic calculation of totals, discounts, and taxes
- Status tracking: DRAFT → CONFIRMED → INVOICED
- Integration with customer master data

#### Purchase Orders (`purchase_orders` and `purchase_order_lines`)
- Purchase order creation and management
- Line item tracking with quantities and pricing
- Received quantity tracking for GRV integration
- Status workflow: DRAFT → CONFIRMED → RECEIVED → INVOICED

#### Goods Received Vouchers (`goods_received_vouchers` and `grv_lines`)
- Records receipt of goods against purchase orders
- Quality status tracking per line item
- Inventory posting capability
- Links to purchase order lines for validation

### 3. Business Logic

#### Sales Order Processing
1. **Order Creation**: Validates customer, items, and pricing
2. **Line Calculations**: Automatic calculation of line totals with discounts and taxes
3. **Order Totals**: Aggregates line items to calculate order totals
4. **Status Management**: Enforces business rules for status transitions
5. **Invoice Conversion**: Creates AR invoice from confirmed orders

#### Purchase Order Processing
1. **Order Creation**: Validates supplier and item availability
2. **Quantity Tracking**: Maintains ordered vs received quantities
3. **GRV Integration**: Links to goods receipt process
4. **Open Lines**: Provides visibility of items pending receipt

#### GRV Processing
1. **Receipt Recording**: Captures actual quantities received
2. **Quality Control**: Tracks quality status per line item
3. **Inventory Updates**: Posts receipts to inventory with weighted average costing
4. **PO Updates**: Updates purchase order received quantities
5. **Invoice Creation**: Generates AP invoices from posted GRVs

### 4. Integration Points

#### AR Integration
- Sales orders can be converted to AR invoices
- Links through OE document type configuration
- Automatic transaction number generation

#### AP Integration
- GRVs can be converted to supplier invoices
- Maintains audit trail from PO → GRV → Invoice
- Updates supplier balances

#### Inventory Integration
- GRV posting updates inventory quantities
- Weighted average cost calculation
- Creates inventory transaction records
- Updates item costs based on receipts

### 5. Key Features

#### Document Number Generation
- Automatic sequential numbering with prefixes
- Format: SO2412xxxx (Sales Orders), PO2412xxxx (Purchase Orders), etc.
- Month-based sequences for easy tracking

#### Validation Rules
- Customer/supplier validation
- Item availability checks
- Quantity validation against available stock
- Period validation for transaction dates
- Status-based edit restrictions

#### Reporting Capabilities
- Filter by customer/supplier
- Status-based filtering
- Date range queries
- Open purchase order lines report
