## üîÑ Iterative Development Notes

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic CRUD operations for each module
2. **Test Early**: Implement tests alongside features
3. **User Feedback**: Get feedback after each phase
4. **Documentation**: Update docs as you build
5. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize continuously

## üìö Next Steps

1. Set up development environment
2. Create initial project structure
3. Start with Phase 1: Foundation Setup
4. Follow the roadmap incrementally
5. Adjust timeline based on complexity and feedback
