Okay, let's create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) outline for your "vinea" web-based Sage Evolution clone, with a strong focus on the Inventory, Sales (Order Entry), and Accounting (GL, AR, AP) modules.

This PRD is designed to guide your development process for an initial phase (MVP) focusing on these core areas. It assumes you are building a multi-user web application using your chosen tech stack (React/Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database).

Product Requirements Document (PRD): vinea Core ERP

Document Version: 1.0
Date: [Insert Date]
Authors: [Your Name(s)]
Project Phase: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - Focusing on Core Modules

Introduction

1.1 Project Name: vinea

1.2 Product Description: vinea is a web-based business management application designed to provide core ERP functionality, inspired by Sage Evolution's established workflows. It aims to offer a user-friendly, scalable solution for Small to Medium Businesses (SMBs).

1.3 Purpose of this Document: This document defines the requirements for the initial phase of the vinea project, focusing on the foundational Accounting, Inventory, and Sales (Order Entry) modules. It outlines the goals, scope, user stories, and functional/non-functional requirements to guide the development team.

1.4 Alignment with Sage Evolution Documentation: This PRD draws heavily on the provided Sage Evolution System Requirements, Installation Guide, User Guide Table of Contents, Software License Agreement, and Data Protection documents to understand core functionalities and workflows. It does not aim to replicate Sage's specific UI or underlying code, but rather to build equivalent functionality in a web environment.

Design / Technical Considerations

8.1 Stack: React/Next.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), PostgreSQL (Database).

8.2 ORM: Use SQLAlchemy or a similar ORM for database interactions.

8.3 API Design: Design a RESTful API with clear endpoints for each resource and action. Use FastAPI's type hinting and OpenAPI generation for documentation.

8.4 Frontend Architecture: Utilize Next.js features for routing, server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) where beneficial for performance. Use TypeScript for type safety.

8.5 Styling: Implement styling using Tailwind CSS.

8.6 Authentication: Implement token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) managed by the backend.

8.7 Background Jobs: Consider using a task queue (like Celery with FastAPI) for potentially long-running or asynchronous tasks in future phases (e.g., bulk imports, complex reports).

8.8 Database Schema: Design the PostgreSQL schema based on the identified entities and their relationships, prioritizing data integrity. Use appropriate data types for financial values (e.g., DECIMAL or NUMERIC).

Open Questions / Future Considerations

Exact format and required data fields for all in-scope reports need detailed specification.

Precision requirements for currency and quantities.

Handling of tax calculations (VAT/GST) – will this be a configuration or hardcoded based on region?

Specific import/export needs for master data or transactions?

Requirements for data archiving or purging?

Should the system handle multi-location inventory tracking in a later phase?

Is there a need for multi-company support within a single installation?

Detailed requirements for user interface interactions and workflows.

This outline provides a solid starting point. As you move through development, you will need to flesh out the functional requirements (Section 6) with much more detail, potentially creating separate requirement documents or user stories for each specific screen or workflow. The user stories (Section 5) help ensure the requirements are tied back to actual user needs. Remember to revisit and update this PRD as your project evolves.)
